# Customer Order Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates my data entry and data cleaning skills using Microsoft Excel. It features a simulated customer order dataset that progresses from raw, unstructured data to a fully cleaned and formatted table ready for analysis and reporting.

## File Included
- `customer-order-data-v2.xlsx` – Contains three sheets:
  - Raw Data
  - Cleaned Data
  - Summary

---

## Sheet 1: Raw Data
- Simulated messy customer order entries with no structured format
- Issues include:
  - Mixed and inconsistent text/capitalization
  - Scattered data without tables
  - Blank rows/columns and merged cells
  - Inconsistent date formats
  - Missing quantity and total price values
  - Invalid ZIP codes
  - Combined city/state formats (e.g., “New York, NY”)

---

## Sheet 2: Cleaned Data
- Converted unstructured data into a clean, usable table
- Split combined fields using **Text to Columns**
- Added **Total Purchase** column (Quantity × Unit Price)
- Applied proper **currency formatting** for prices and totals
- Created **drop-down list** for Payment Status:
  - Paid, Unpaid, Processing, Pending, Refund
- Applied **color-coded highlighting** based on payment status for visual clarity
- Standardized delivery cities (e.g., “New York, NY” → “New York”)
- Identified and corrected **invalid ZIP codes**

---

## Sheet 3: Summary
- Provides an overview of total orders, revenue, and payment status breakdown
- Includes a **pie chart** visualizing Payment Status distribution with percentage labels
- Highlights the proportion of Paid, Unpaid, Processing, Pending, and Refund orders
- Demonstrates ability to analyze and present cleaned data in a clear, visual format

---

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning, formatting, formulas, conditional logic, and charts)

This project is part of my data entry and data cleaning portfolio.
